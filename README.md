# Cardiovascular Disease Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) using a dataset containing medical and lifestyle information. The aim is to identify patterns and correlations in the data to provide insights into the prevention and management of CVD.

## Key Features
1. **Data Transformations**:
   - Calculated Body Mass Index (BMI).
   - Classified blood pressure and age groups.
   - Generated a health risk score based on cholesterol, glucose levels, and smoking habits.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Performed descriptive statistics and correlation analysis.
   - Visualized relationships between risk factors like smoking, activity levels, cholesterol levels, and CVD incidence.

3. **Risk Factor Insights**:
   - Higher cholesterol and inactivity are strongly linked to cardiovascular disease.
   - Older age groups and smokers have a significantly increased risk.

4. **Data Integration**:
   - Merged datasets to include additional health parameters like family history, diet score, and stress levels.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Sources**: [Cardiovascular Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset)

## Visualizations
- Heatmaps to display correlations between features.
- Bar and scatter plots to analyze risk factors.
- Distribution plots for cholesterol and BMI levels by CVD status.

## Key Insights
1. Lifestyle changes like increased activity and smoking cessation can significantly reduce CVD risk.
2. Higher cholesterol and glucose levels are critical indicators for identifying high-risk groups.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of lifestyle and health metrics in determining cardiovascular disease risk, offering insights that could guide prevention strategies and personalized care.
